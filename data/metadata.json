    "abstract": "Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease affecting millions worldwide. Physical therapy interventions have shown promise in managing symptoms and improving function. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 200 patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either structured physical therapy (n=100) or standard care (n=100). The physical therapy group received 12 weeks of supervised exercises including str...",
